# Using MDI++ #

## Example Analysis ##

The `demo` subdirectory includes some example data and scripts that
can be used to ensure that MDI++ is functioning correctly, as well as
providing a template for your own analysis.

TODO: more details

# File formats #

MDI++ reads and writes a variety of somewhat standard format CSV
files, these have allowed easy interoperability of data between MDI,
R, Python and Matlab.  The program assumes rectangular input format,
i.e. all rows have the same number of columns.  The for row contains
the feature names and the first column the names of the items, for
example:

    expression, idx, idy
	gene 1, 1.5, 2.3
	gene 2, 1.4, 4.0
	gene 3, 2.3, 0.7

defines a file with three genes as items, each having expression data
across two individuals and hence would be suited to the independent
Gaussians datatype.  The value of the topleft cell will be ignored,
but can be useful to remind you what the data is.  The format of the
numeric data here changes depending on the *data type*.

There are two outputs from MDI, the output always present is the MC
output that targets the posterior distribution of cluster partitions.
When feature selection is turned on another file is generated
describing whether each feature is turned on or off.  For example, the
main MCMC output for clustering the above data as independent
Gaussians could look like:

    MassParameter_1,Dataset1_gene 1,Dataset1_gene 2,Dataset1_gene 3
    1,   1,1,2
    1.1, 1,1,1
    1.2, 2,2,1

The first column describes the Mass associated with the Dirichlet
Process of behind the clustering for the dataset.  This is followed by
gene 1 and 2 both in cluster 1 in the first sample, all genes were in
found to be compatible in the second sample.  When more than one
dataset is being clustered simultaneously there will be a series of
"Phi" variables describing the agreement between all pairwise
combinations of datasets.  More formally, given $N$ datasets each
containing $n$" items, the columns will be:

1. $N$ Mass Paramaters, followed by
2. $N*(N-1)/2$ Phis, and
3. $Nn$ cluster partition variables.

## Data Types ##

The rectangular CSV file format above applies to all datatypes
currently supported.  However, similar to the previous implementation
missing values are not supported and each model places additional
constraints upon the basic format.

### `N`: Independent Gaussians ###

This datatype assumes that each value is an independent draw from a
Gaussian with mean and variance inferred for each feature and cluster.
The values are floating point numbers and most standard formats are
supported, but I believe the decimal point has to be a '`.`',
i.e. period, and I'd not recommend using thousands separators.

The data should be normalised before running MDI such that cluster
means will be approximately standard normal and it's unlikely that
cluster variance will be greater than one.

Feature selection is supported, with clusters sharing the same mean
and variance when their feature is "off".

### `GP`: Gaussian Process ###

This datatype takes data in a very similar format to the independent
Gaussians, except that the feature names are defined to be the time
points at which the data was sampled.

Feature selection is not supported due to covariance existing between
features, and time should run over approximately [0â€“1] and data
shouldn't be too far off standard-normal.

### `M`: Multinomial ###

This datatype is for unordered discrete data and assumes data are
integer values, with each feature being independent.

Feature selection is supported in a similar way to the independent
Gaussians.

### `BW`: Bag of Words ###

The Bag-of-Words datatype is somewhat different from the above; it is
assumed that there are several "words" that can appear multiple times
for each item.  Each feature is the sum of the number of times this
word appears associated with this item, values are therefore positive
integers.

Feature selection is unsupported for similar reasons to the GP
datatype.

## Analysis Scripts ##

One MDI++ has run the Monte Carlo output can be read into another
program for further analysis and plotting.  I have included various
scripts for analysing this posterior in R and there is a
iPython/Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of these scripts.
